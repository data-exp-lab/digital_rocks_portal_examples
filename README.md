## installation 

requirements are in `requirements.txt`

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note on napari: with newer macs with the M2 chip, you may have issues installing `pyQT5` (one of the requirements in the above file). In that case, it's easier to just try `pyQT6` instead (napari is working on QT6 support, but in my experience most things seem to work OK).
